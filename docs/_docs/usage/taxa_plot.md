title: taxa_plot.pl
---

This script generates a taxonomy barplot for `top N` taxa given an input feature table for each sample in the study. It also generates a taxonomy barplot where relative abundances are averaged per group as specified by the user for catgorical variable.

# Usage

```
perl taxa_plot.pl <feature_table.tsv> <metadata.tsv> <column_group:g1:g2> <output_dir> <output_prefix> <top_N> <figure_width> <figure_height>

   feature_table.tsv         path to the taxonomic feature table of relative abundances
   metadata.tsv              path to the study metadata table with group information
   column_group:g1:g2        group-column from metadata table and group levels in the format [column_group:group1:group2]
   output_dir                path to output directory
   output_prefix             prefix that will be used for output files
   top_N                     top N taxa to show in the stack bar plot, remaining taxa are grouped together as 'Others'
   figure_width              output figure width
   figure_heigth             output figure height
```

## Required inputs

- all input is required and the ordering of parameters must also be the same as specified in the usage


## Outputs

Several outputs will be generated by this module, the files are organised into the following directory structure
